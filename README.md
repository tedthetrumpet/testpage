# Maintaining and enhancing excellence

> ‘Getting the design, delivery and ‘learning ethos’ of the Masters programme right is arguably the single most important way that conservatoires can ensure that they are simultaneously giving students an appropriate professional training and, […] functioning as centres of higher learning with a legitimate role in all three higher-education cycles.’
    <cite>(Polifonia 2015 p21)</cite>

A key priority for the postgraduate review is to maintain and enhance the excellence of our current programmes. It is well recognised that masters degrees have in many respects a dual nature (Polifonia 2015, QAA 2015, SHEEC 2013). They functions as both the end-point of study for some students, and a stepping stone to a higher level for others. They are at one and the same time ‘more of the same’, a continuation of undergraduate study, and a move into a qualitatively different relationship with the student’s praxis. They have the potential to combine a research orientation with professional relevance, and, from an institutional perspective, may recruit from both continuing students and those new to the Conservatoire.

There are many aspects to what has sometimes been called ‘mastersness’; the qualities that make the second cycle distinct and different from either undergraduate or postgraduate level study. A 2013 report of the Scottish Higher Education Enhancement Committee (SHEEC) project ‘Learning from International Practice: The Postgraduate Taught Student Experience’ drew on research and case studies with staff and students in Scottish, other UK and international higher education institutions to identify seven ‘facets’ of masters study, that may be summarised as follows:

**Complexity:** recognising and dealing with the provisiional nature of knowledge, the application of knowledge in practice, conceptual complexity, and the complexity of learning process.

**Abstraction:** constructing new knowledge and meanings on the basis of prior work, or applying what has been learned to a different domain or situation.

**Depth of learning:** acquiring new knowledge and skills and/or using them in new ways – for example, exploring a narrow topic in depth, or taking an novel interdisciplinary approach to a well-studied area.

**Research and enquiry:** developing a critical research attitude that both supports professional praxis and looks ahead to further study at a higher level.

**Autonomy:** taking responsibility for one’s own study in terms of self-organisation, motivation, choice, and approach to learning.

**Unpredictability:** drecognising that real world problems are by their nature messy and complex, and being creative with the use of skills, knowledge and experience to solve these problems.

**Professionalism:** displaying appropriate professional attitudes, behavior and values in whatever discipline/occupational area is chosen, including learning ethical behaviours, developing academic integrity, dealing with challenges to professionalism, recognising the need to reflect on practice, and becoming part of a professional community.

Although there are undoubtably other ways in which to conceptualise ‘mastersness’, the framework offered by the study referenced above is coherent, up-to-date, appropriate to the Scottish context, and based on a secure research foundation. We therefore propose to use these seven ‘facets’ as a lens through which to view both our current masters offering and any newly proposed awards, with the aim of ensuring that we maintain and enhance the excellence of our postgraduate programmes.
